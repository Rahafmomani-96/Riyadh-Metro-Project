# 🚇 Riyadh Metro Project – Power BI Dashboard & Data Story

Welcome! This repository is home to a detailed Power BI dashboard that explores the **Riyadh Metro and Bus Transit System**. What started as a personal project to better understand how public transport is developing in Riyadh quickly turned into a fascinating journey through data, maps, and infrastructure insights.

## 📊 About the Project

Riyadh is in the middle of a massive urban transformation, and the metro project is one of its centerpieces. This dashboard brings together metro and bus data to answer questions like:

- How are stations distributed across the city?
- Which metro stations serve the most lines?
- What types of stations are being built — elevated, underground, or at grade?
- How are bus routes organized in terms of origin and destination?
- What are the highest-rated stations — and which ones need improvement?

## 🧠 Key Insights

Here’s a quick snapshot of what you’ll find in the dashboard:

- 🚉 **83 Metro Stations** across **6 Metro Lines**
- 🚌 **117 Bus Lines** and over **3,000 Bus Stations**
- 📍 Station Types: Elevated, At Grade, Shallow/Deep Underground
- ⭐ Station ratings: from 1.0 to 5.0 — visualized and compared
